      "Civic Media researcher, Ethan Zuckerman [1] once conceived of civic engagement along two axes. The first axis runs from thick to thin.  Ethan defines \"thin\" as \"actions that require little thought\", and \"think\" the oppoiste.  The second axis runs from \"symbolic\" to \"impactful\" where \"symbolic\" actions tend to have to do with \"voice\", showing that you stand with something bumpter stickers, or a growing a beard while your team is in the playoffs.  Impactful actions on the other hand, have clearer, demonstrable change.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's easy to assume that the ideal modes of civic participation are thick and impactful.  However, you can have thin and impactful, take voting for example. While voter ID laws are are making this form of participation thicker as of late, in general, it is a simple matter of showing up, pressing a few buttons, and later that evening you will have created a change which will have significant impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social media has proven itself to have the ability to cause high impact as a very thin form of engagement.  Researcher Clay Shirky has pointed out that the Internet extends the advantages of information and coordination, formerly relegated only to large organizations, to individual public actors.  This was exemplifed recently by the rescinding of a book deal between Martin Literary Management and Juror B37 from the Trayvon Martin case. [3] This, only hours after Twitter user @MoreandAgain posted a tweet contianing the information of the literary firm and a call to her 1600 followers to request that @sharlenemartin drop the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "What most success stores such as these have in common is that 1) they were made up of a short but intense spikes in participation. 2) The impact sought was well defined and did not require a systematic change.  A very small group of people were required to enact the change as a result of the pressure (a literary agent), and the change they were pressured to make was binary (do or do not publish a book).\n",
      "\n",
      "Systemic change relies upon sustained participation.  Sustained participation online requires certain types actors just as sustained participation offline.  Some will be leaders, highly engaged, and motivated to stay and engage of their own accord.  Movements are not made up solely of leaders but also follwers, perhaps less pajoritively, those who are inspired and interested enough to stand together in a movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation on Twitter regarding the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson presented an interesting opporunity to inquire into user engagement.  With the Trayvon Martin case still very present in the cultural consciousness, citizens were prepared for the order of events that were soon to come; grand jury indictment and potentially a criminal trial.  This meant that people were openly waiting and ready for the next milestone.  What that meant for data science is that much in the same reporters were standing by waiting for reacction to the grand jury decision to come down, so to could data journalists.  Therefore, the opoortunity presented itself to use data captured from the initial event and compaire it with data from the next milestone to see how user engagement changed.\n",

Due to Twitter's terms of service, Ed was not able to give us the tweets directly, however, he was able to provide the tweet ID's which could then be \"reydtrated\" using a program that he created called -- <a href=\"http://example.com/\" target=\"_blank\">twarc</a> (short for Twitter archive).\n",

We also narrowd down our data to only those users who language setting was English since we had expected to do some NLP. We also narrow down our data by taking a look at users who had contributed more than 10 tweets during the initial August period.  Our reasoning for this was that a user should show some initial threshold of interest.\n",

We did discover that the pymongo was hanging on our queries and we needed to bypass pymongo. We used the MongoDB mongoexport utiity to export csv files to use for analysis in IPython. We then incorporated MongoDB as the data aggregator.\n",
